# CRISPR sgRNA Predictor

A deep learning-based tool designed to predict and rank single-guide RNA (sgRNA) candidates for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing applications.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project leverages a trained neural network model (`crispr_model.h5`) to evaluate and score potential sgRNA sequences based on their predicted efficiency and specificity. The tool aids researchers in selecting optimal sgRNA candidates for targeted gene editing.

## üß¨ Features

* Predicts sgRNA efficiency and specificity scores.
* Ranks sgRNA candidates based on model predictions.
* Supports input sequences for genes like *lacZ* and *rpoB*.
* Provides insights into GC-content and error correlations.
